Customizing the welcome.html File

Like any good hacker, I've come up with my own little syntax for this
file, so you'll need to bear with me.  In the most basic sense, it can
be a normal HTML file with a few additional tags that I've added to
it.  Unlike the rest of the PennAve, this file is not translated using
an XSLT engine, so you don't need to worry about making 100% certain
it's valid XHTML.  This was done mainly to be able to add in
javascript on these pages.

Please note: this formatting document only applies to the initial
welcome page when you visit a gallery.  To change the design of the
main gallery and photo views, you'll need to modify
pennave/static/xslt/pennave.xsl.

WARNING: because this engine is VERY fragile, the entirely of a paLink
and paImg command MUST be on the same line.  If they're not, you'll
get some very unpredictable results.

paLink
******
creates a link to something in PennAve.  Takes one mandatory
property and one optional property.

mandatory property:
type: the type of link, acceptable value is "browse"
optional property:
categories: a comma separated list of category names.  If you want it
to include all subcategories, place a '+' at the end of the game.

This element gets translated into an <a href="...">...</a> setup.  Any
child elements are properly copied over and any additional elements
you wish to include are copied too.  Thus if you wanted to a do a
simple link to the main browse page for your catalog you could do:

<paLink type="browse">Browse all my photos</paLink>

If we wanted to get fancy and link to all my favorites with people in
them and have the link with a green background, we could do something
like this:
<paLink type="browse" categories="Favorites,People+"
style="background-color: green;">Favorite Photos of People</paLink>

Hopefully you get the idea.

*****
paImg
*****

Very similar to paLink above, but inserts a reference to an image.
Also takes two properties, but the properties depend on the type
parameter.

mandatory property:
type: the type of image, either "stacked" or "thumbnail".  If type is
"stacked" then requires tag "categories".  If type is "thumbnail" then
requires tag "idNum"
optional properties:
categories: the names of the categories to create a stacked graphic
from.  The syntax is the same as the syntax for paLink.
idNum: the numeric ID number of the photo you wish to thumbnail.

For example, the following will create an image reference to photo 32
in your database:
<paImg type="thumbnail" idNum="32"/>
You can figure out what the id number of a photo is by mousing over it
and looking at what the little red box says.

If you'd like to create a nice little stacked photo icon, great for
browsing sets, you can do something like this:
<paImg type="stacked" categories="Favorites,Events+"/>

As before, any properties not parsed are copied over as are all child
elements.  Pretty slick like that.

**********
::PREFIX::
**********

A special string that is used for automatically generating full URL
links.  For example if your installation of PennAve is running at
http://yourwebsite.com/pennave/ then a link that says <a
href="::PREFIX::tags/"> will link to http://yourwebsite.com/pennave/tags/
