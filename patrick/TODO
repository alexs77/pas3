Things to Do on PennAve

* fix the javascript mouseovers of pictures so they actually follow the cursor
* figure out how to do mouseovers in IE properly
* better graphics integration
  in particular, I'm talking about moving back and forth when viewing a set of tags
* allow browsing by date
* maybe some online help would be nice
* comment source code
* control panel for slide show
* optimize slide show for more efficient fading (canvas?)
* clustering of hierarchical tags.  For example "events" should be bigger than
  any of the tags underneath it -- even though right now it doesn't even show
  up.
* drill down interface for tags
* regular expressions to rewrite the file locations
* better options for xsltRender - platforms should be rendered by default even
  if xsltRender is true.  Only working platforms such as IE 7 and FireFox
  should have the option to get the XML.
