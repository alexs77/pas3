PennAve - A Online Photo Gallery Application
Copyright (c) 2004-2007 Patrick Wagstrom

Version 0.4
***********

Whats New?
 * Instead of always rendering a client side graphic for stacked images, the
   simple markup language can now utilize the canvas tag present in newer
   versions of mozilla.
 * EXIF tags in the output XML.  This corresponds to the EXIF RDF format
 * Handles the Last-Modified header on generated images, allowing caching
 * Ability to reverse the order of photos being viewed

Bug Fixes?
 * Some improved support for UTF-8 tag names
 * Images that have the orientation EXIF tag set will be rotated accordingly
 * Fixed crash on empty set
 * Fixed problems with uppercase filenames
