Major Changes to PennAve:

Version 0.5 (forthcoming):
 * support for multiple versions of the same file
 * support for localized versions of PennAve.
  
Version 0.4 (May 23, 2007):
 * Lost-Modified is sent on images allowing them to be cached
 * On systems that support the canvas tag, we do some nice canvas drawing for
   the stacked images on the main page.
 * all XML is now placed in a namespace
   This means that there are changes required for any customized XSLT that
   you may use on your site.  In particular, the top level elements are
   now pa:tagBrowse and pa:photoView.
 * Lots of fixes for UTF-8, hopefully we got them all
 * A brand spanking new user interface that doesn't suck nearly as much as
   the previous one.
 * Ability to do server side translation of XSLT files by setting
   xsltRender=True in the global section of the configuration file.
 * Ability to show the default version of an image instead of the original
   version by setting defaultImage=True in the configuration file.
 * Upgraded to CherryPy 3.0
 * Almost all navigation now possible without JavaScript
 * Lots of small bug fixes.

Version 0.3:
 * slideshow, with fancy fading effects
 * rss feeds when browsing sets of tags
 * ability to list all tags under a topic (not entirely revealed
 through UI)
 * customizable start page for PennAve - useful so you don't overwhelm
 Grandma when she browses your photos.
 * improved speed thanks to SQL caching
 * cool little stacked photo effect, useful for welcome page
