2007-06-07  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* src/pennave.py: created new xmlString function to replace all those old

	noted by Alexander Skwar.
	
	* src/default.conf, src/hedgehog.conf: change the default address to 127.0.0.1

	Skwar for finding all of these issues.
	* src/pennave.py: fix bug with not adding trailing / to URLs
	* static/js/canvas.js: unbreak opera by disallowing canvas objects

	for adding extensions to image names
	
2007-06-05  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* src/EXIF.py: made interpretation of EXIF tags VERY loose. To make it strict
	again, set CONFIG_STRICT in EXIF.py. Like the web, I believe the default should
	be to accept.
	
2007-05-31  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>
	
	* INSTALL: instructions for mod_python

	* src/pennave.py: changes for mod_python

2007-05-29  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* src/pennave.py: version bump to 0.5svn
	
	* *: lots of changes for 0.4 release
	
2007-05-22  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* static/css/pennave.css: improvements on powered by pennave
	* static/xslt/pennave.xsl; improvements on powered by pennave
	
	* src/images.py: if the actual images can't be found, but a thumbnail is still
	present, the thumbnail for the image will be shown. This can cause a bit of
	misbehavior, but is less obnoxious than the giant error messages.
	
	* static/xslt/pennave.xsl: cleaned up code, added ability to remove tags
	* static/css/pennave.css: restyled some elements
	
	* src/pennave.py: fixed a problem with hiddenTags
	
	* static/css/pennave.css: fixed a small color issue
	
	* src/default.conf: cleaned up configuration and updated
	* src/pennave.py: allow specification of database location and clean up
	launching code
	* static/js/tagSelection.js: last bit of javascript nav code is nuked
	* statix/xslt/pennave.xsl: nuke last bit of javascript nav code
	
	* COPYING: added new license for LiberationSans-Regular.ttf
	* src/LiberationSans-Regular.ttf: font is now included with distribution
	
	* src/pennave.py: fix bug that prevented from rendering stylesheet
	
	* static/css/pennave.css: created div.photoThumbnailHighlight for use when
	photos are highlighted
	* static/js/tagSelection.js: cleaned up code some more. Highlighting photos by
	hovering over tags now works properly.

	* static/css/pennave.css: various CSS changes and fixes to make it look prettier
	* static/js/tagSelection.js: removed unneeded SelectTag function
	* static/xslt/pennave.xsl: updated the default style a bit more
	
	* static/js/tagSelections.js: remove the viewNext javascript function. This
	function can be recreated easier in XSLT anyway.
	* static/xslt/pennave.xsl: modified pageFlicker to remove the old javascript
	call to viewNext.
	* src/pennave.py: while viewing the tags, creates a new node called hookArgs
	with children called arg to represent all of the values on the hook. Hopefully,
	this helps eliminate some of the reliance on javascript for more critical
	functions.

	* src/images.py: patch from Alexander Skwar to fix issues with filenames that
	are too long. The thumbnails are now stored as the md5 of their previous
	filenames to avoid issues with filesystems that have a maximum number of
	characters in filenames.
	
	* static/js/canvas.js: silently fail if it can't find the div element
	
	* src/pennave.py: configuration file cleanup, number of photos for canvas is no
	longer hardcoded
	* static/js/canvas.js: now a little object oriented. Also, allows jitter for the
	images on the canvas to show a bit more. All configuration parameters at the top.
	* src/feeds.py: cleaned up configuration issues
	
2007-05-21  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* static/js/tagSelection.js: fix some trailing / issues
	
2007-05-20  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* src/pennave.py: updated for CherryPy 3.0
	* src/exiftools.py: updated for CherryPy 3.0
	* src/pennave.conf: apparently CherryPy 3.0 needs two config files

	* src/feeds.py (rss): fixed problem where RSS feeds would not
	indicate what tags they included
	* static/xsl/pennave.xsl: accidentally forget RSS links

	* src/pennave.py: replaced the nice and slick XML method to
	generate static welcome page with a hackneyed HTML method.  The
	reason for this is because if we generated the HTML from XML there
	were errors in the script tag and nothing would be rendered in
	IE.  ACK!  This way people can use broken HTML all they want.
	* static/xml: removed replaced with html
	* static/html: new directories for HTML output
	
2007-01-29  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>

2006-10-26  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* src/images.py: fixed bug where a 500 error would be returned if
	the file could not be found.  In reality it should be a 404, right
	now it's an error PNG.

	* src/EXIF.py: added new file
	* src/pennave.py: removed exif data
	* src/exiftools.py: new file
